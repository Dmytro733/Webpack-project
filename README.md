 `6.13.4`  
(__-v__ -version);

If you see version in 2 codes, it is good. In you installed npm and node.js.  
If there are no versions, follow the [link](https://wsvincent.com/install-node-js-npm-windows/)

`$ npm install`  
NPM will automagically reference the binary in node_modules for you, and execute the file or command.
